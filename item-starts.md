## The List

- Items are listed in order of power level.
- You should probably not start anything in D class.
- More detail about these items can be found below in the [explanations section](#explanations).
- The ordering is somewhat subjective; other speedrunners may prefer the list be shuffled in some way or another.

## Explanations

### S Class (The Big 2)

S Class items are considered above and beyond anything else present in the game. If you have one of these items and your opponent doesn't, and most other factors are equal, you will probably win the race.

#### Mom's Knife

- At the highest levels of play, Mom's Knife is considered the best item in the game.
- Due to the mechanics of the movement involved with the item, you also have a higher propensity to take damage. If you combine this with all tears-up items being useless with a knife, it is recommended to take all health up items.

#### Epic Fetus

- Considered the second best item; you want to use the missiles to "bomb" out of every room.
- It kills bosses slower than with other builds. However, it does have some powerful specific synergies, like 20/20, The Inner Eye, and Mutant Spider.

#### Ipecac

- Considered the third best item; you want to use the explosive tears to "bomb" out of every room.
- It is more dangerous to use than nearly all other items. It also kills bosses much slower than with other builds. However, it does have some powerful specific synergies, like Dr. Fetus.
- Much like Mom's Knife, it requires a bunch of dedicated practice to utilize most effectively.

#### Sacred Heart

- Much better than it was in Afterbirth+ due to the new homing mechanic and removal of homing bombs.

<br>

### A Class

#### Maw of the Void

- Not as good as it was in Afterbirth+ due to the nerfing of the damage, but still one of the best items in the game.

#### Proptosis

- Triple damage but only if you are very close to the enemy. Good players will get close to (almost) every enemy in order to maximize DPS.

#### Godhead

- n/a

#### Dr. Fetus

- Requires some practice to be able to use effectively, but still easier to play than Ipecac.

<br>

### B Class

#### 20/20

- 75% damage up overall.

#### Magic Mushroom

- Preferred to Cricket's Head since you also get a speed up.

#### Cricket's Head

- n/a

#### Tech.5

- You always want to take coal with this item, since it acts as a damage multiplier.
- Eve's Mascara is a great synergy.

#### Polyphemus

- Generally not worth trading the D6 for Guppy's Head unless your build is completely carried.

#### Crown of Light

- n/a

#### C Section

- n/a

#### Dead Eye

- Don't be overly conservative with the amount of tears that you fire, especially after getting a tears up, as you will not lose the multiplier on every missed shot.

<br>

### C Class

#### Death's Touch

- It is not a damage multiplier, but the large tear size and piercing is multiplicative in that you will often hit many enemies with one shot.
- This is the only item upon that changes the rolling strategy such that you may want to roll a speed up for a tears up (at base speed).
- Tammy's Head becomes very strong with this.

#### Cricket's Body

- Don't start this on Cain, because the low range becomes crippling.

#### Tech X

- You need to fully charge the shot in order to deal the maximum amount of damage.

#### Judas Shadow

- n/a

#### Incubus

- n/a

<br>

### D Class

#### Haemolacria

- Better than in Afterbirth+.

#### Monstro's Lung

- Ipecac and Chocolate Milk are the strongest synergies.

#### Twisted Pair

- Most of the extra tears usually end up missing, so the item is not very good.

#### Chocolate Milk

- Considered to be one of the weakest starting items. If no power level increase from a devil deal is received, then the resulting long Caves 1 and Caves 2 can turn into an automatic loss.

### E Class

#### Sacrificial Dagger

- Rotates too quickly in order to use effectively. Also does not deal as much damage as it did in Afterbirth+ (less tick rate).
