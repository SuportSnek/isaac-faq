# The Binding of Isaac: Repentance Modding - Common Responses & FAQ

## Format Code

When asking for help, it is common to post a code-snippet. Before posting code, **please format it with an auto-formatter** so that it can be easily understood by others.

- In Lua, use [Lua Beautifier](https://goonlinetools.com/lua-beautifier/), [LuaFormatter](https://github.com/Koihik/LuaFormatter), or [lua-fmt](https://github.com/trixnz/lua-fmt).
- In TypeScript, use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

## No Screenshots

When asking for help, it is common to post a screenshot of your code. **Don't do this**, because it isn't editable or copy-pastable. Instead, post the actual text code of the code using triple backticks, like this:

```
\`\`\`
local foo = "bar"
Isaac.DebugString(foo)
\`\`\`
```
