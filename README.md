# The Binding of Isaac: Repentance Modding - Common Responses & FAQ

## Use Discord Syntax Highlighting

When pasting code into Discord, make sure to paste it in a "code block" by using triple backticks. And make sure to use syntax highlighting for the language, by typing the name of the language next to the backticks.

For example, this is a code snippet for Lua:

````
```lua
local foo = "bar"
Isaac.DebugString(foo)
```
````

Or, a code snippet for TypeScript:

````
```ts
const foo = "bar";
Isaac.DebugString(foo);
```
````

<br />

## Format Code

When asking for help, it is common to post a code-snippet. Before posting code, **please format it with an auto-formatter** so that it can be easily understood by others.

- In Lua, use [Lua Beautifier](https://goonlinetools.com/lua-beautifier/), [LuaFormatter](https://github.com/Koihik/LuaFormatter), or [lua-fmt](https://github.com/trixnz/lua-fmt).
- In TypeScript, use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

## No Screenshots

When asking for help, it is common to post a screenshot of your code. **Don't do this**, because it isn't editable or copy-pastable. Instead, post the actual text of the code. See the section on [Discord syntax highlighting](#use-discord-syntax-highlighting).

## Use Minimal, Reproducible Examples

When asking for help, it is common to post a bunch of code that is unrelated to the problem. This makes questions hard to understand and usually means that the person asking the question is putting forth very little effort.

Please read [this StackOverflow post on how to create minimal, reproducable examples](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).

## Don't Use Link Previews

Link previews can clutter the conversion, turning a tiny message into a massive wall of text. It is courteous to enclose all links in <>.

For example:

```
Here's a link to my code: <https://github.com/IsaacScript/isaacscript-common/blob/main/src/functions/array.ts#L3-L16>
```
